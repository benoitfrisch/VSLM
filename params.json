The program will read in a calibrated .wav file and allow the user to analyze it as one would analyze a sound field with a sound level meter. The software implements Fast, Slow, Impulse and LEQ; A, C and Flat Weighting; Ln and Noise Dose analysis; Octave and 1/3 Octave band analysis; high resolution FFT analysis and spectrograms. Band analysis can be made using fast FFT methods or slower, but ANSI standard methods.\r\n\r\nSource code requires MATLAB + Signal Processing Toolbox.\r\nDeveloped under MATLAB R2010a (but might work with some earlier versions)\r\nExecutable version does not require MATLAB and runs under Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7.\r\n\r\nThis software does not do real-time sound level measurement. It does not read from a sound card.\r\nIt has been developed for the analysis of calibrated digital recordings.\r\n\r\n## WINDOWS EXECUTABLE USERS:\r\nWindows users without MATLAB and the signal processing toolbox installed should download the vslm_0_4_1_pkg.exe.  \r\nThis file includes the windows executables, help files, and MATLAB runtime libraries.\r\n\r\nMove the vslm_0_4_1_pkg.exe file to the directory where you want the vslm executable to be installed (create the directory if necessary) and run the file.  This will extract the contents into the directory and install the MATLAB runtime library if necessary\r\n\r\nTo start vslm run the vslm.exe executable.  This is actually a wrapper program that runs the true executable, matgui, and shows asplash screen while the MATLAB runtime library loads (this can take a while).\r\n\r\nThe documentation includes vslm.chm, a windows helpfile format help file\r\nvslm.htm and the /files subdirectory which contains an html format help file\r\nvslm.pdf which is a PDF version of the same documentation\r\nvslm.hnd is the HelpNDoc file which is the source file for all the documentation formats\r\n\r\nThe archive also includes vslm_0_4_1.fig and vslm_0_4_1.m which are the MATLAB source files\r\n\r\n## MATLAB USERS\r\n\r\nMatlab users should download the vslm_0_4_1_matlab_source.zip and \r\nvslm_0_4_1_docs.zip and unzip both to the same directory.  \r\nUsers should then run vslm_0_4_1.m to run vslm.\r\n\r\nvslm_0_4_1.m requires the signal processing toolbox.\r\n\r\nvslm_0_4_1.m was developed using MATLAB R2010.  \r\n\r\nI do not know what earlier versions with which it can run.\r\n",
